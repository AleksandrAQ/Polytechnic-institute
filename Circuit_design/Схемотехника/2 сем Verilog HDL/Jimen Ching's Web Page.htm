<P>Welcome to the VBS project homepage. VBS stands for Verilog Behavioral 
Simulator. This was a software I wrote for my senior design project at the 
University of Hawaii. Since then, I have extensively added more features. This 
homepage is a depository of new ideas and updates of changes to VBS. 
<P>Version 1.3.7 of VBS is now released. See the README file below for details. 
<P>Below are more links about VBS.

  of the <A href="http://geda.seul.org/">gEDA</A> project. The gEDA-dev mailing 
  list will be used for discussions of VBS. It is shared by other applications 
  that are part of the gEDA project. To join the mailing list, send an email to

<P>Misc:

  <LI>I am the new maintainer of a cross-platform Win32 API library. The library 
  is called TWIN and you can visit <A href="http://www.willows.com/">Willows</A> 
  , the company that owns this library. I plan to add multimedia support to the 
  list of supported APIs. I should also mention that this library comes with a 
  Windows emulator. It can run on any platform that TWIN supports. For platforms 
  that does not support the binary emulator, here are some sample <A 
  href="ftp://ftp.willows.com/pub/twin/samples/twin-samples-1.0.5.tar.gz">sources</A> 
  to link with the library. The current CVS tree supports building the MFC 
  library. 
  <LI>I also maintain the re-release of the VPP software package by Hemi Thaker. 
  The new re-release is called <A 
  href="http://www.flex.com/~jching/vbpp-current.tar.gz">VBPP</A> version 1.0.3. 
  You can take a look at the <A

  was, it is my call sign. It is related to amatuer radio. Check out the Hawaii
